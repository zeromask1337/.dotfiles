- Reordered install steps: clone now runs before brew/bundle to ensure .Brewfile exists.
- Updated README-BOOTSTRAP.md to reflect new order.
- Updated tests/docker/test-runner.sh to match new order and use local repo for cloning (avoiding SSH issues).
- Fixed issue where brew bundle failed with --no-lock (removed the flag).
- Verified that bundle finds .Brewfile and installs packages.
- Verified SSH step no longer generates keys (already implemented).
- Updated Docker tests to mount ~/.ssh read-only instead of using SSH agent forwarding.
- Verified SSH tests pass with mounted keys.
- Modified install.sh to make missing 'stow' command a hard error (die) instead of a warning.
- Verified that running the stow step without stow installed now fails with a clear error.
- Updated tests/docker/test-runner.sh to fix test sequencing: removed bundle and stow from standalone step tests.
- Verified that test_all_prefixes correctly tests the cumulative flow including clone before bundle.
- Verified per-step tests pass for independent steps (preflight, ssh, clone, brew).
