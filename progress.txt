- Reordered install steps: clone now runs before brew/bundle to ensure .Brewfile exists.
- Updated README-BOOTSTRAP.md to reflect new order.
- Updated tests/docker/test-runner.sh to match new order and use local repo for cloning (avoiding SSH issues).
- Fixed issue where brew bundle failed with --no-lock (removed the flag).
- Verified that bundle finds .Brewfile and installs packages.
