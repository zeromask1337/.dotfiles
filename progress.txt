00001| - Reordered install steps: clone now runs before brew/bundle to ensure .Brewfile exists.
00002| - Updated README-BOOTSTRAP.md to reflect new order.
00003| - Updated tests/docker/test-runner.sh to match new order and use local repo for cloning (avoiding SSH issues).
00004| - Fixed issue where brew bundle failed with --no-lock (removed the flag).
00005| - Verified that bundle finds .Brewfile and installs packages.
00006| - Verified SSH step no longer generates keys (already implemented).
00007| - Updated Docker tests to mount ~/.ssh read-only instead of using SSH agent forwarding.
00008| - Verified SSH tests pass with mounted keys.
